  abstract = {Motivation: The integration of multiple datasets remains a key challenge in systems biology and genomic medicine. Modern highthroughput technologies generate a broad array of different data types, providing distinct\textemdash{}but often complementary\textemdash{}information. We present a Bayesian method for the unsupervised integrative modelling of multiple datasets, which we refer to as MDI (Multiple Dataset Integration). MDI can integrate information from a wide range of different datasets and data types simultaneously (including the ability to model time series data explicitly using Gaussian processes). Each dataset is modelled using a Dirichlet-multinomial allocation (DMA) mixture model, with dependencies between these models captured through parameters that describe the agreement among the datasets. Results: Using a set of six artificially constructed time series datasets, we show that MDI is able to integrate a significant number of datasets simultaneously, and that it successfully captures the underlying structural similarity between the datasets. We also analyse a variety of real Saccharomyces cerevisiae datasets. In the two-dataset case, we show that MDI's performance is comparable with the present state-of-the-art. We then move beyond the capabilities of current approaches and integrate gene expression, chromatin immunoprecipitation\textendash{}chip and protein\textendash{}protein interaction data, to identify a set of protein complexes for which genes are co-regulated during the cell cycle. Comparisons to other unsupervised data integration techniques\textemdash{}as well as to non-integrative approaches\textemdash{}demonstrate that MDI is competitive, while also providing information that would be difficult or impossible to extract using other methods.},

  volume = {89},
  abstract = {This article describes a method of "grouping" and "collapsing" in using the Gibbs sampler and proves from an operator theory viewpoint that the method is in general beneficial. The norms of theforward operators associated with the corresponding nonreversible Markov chains are used to discriminate among different simulation schemes. When applied to Bayesian missing data problems, the idea of collapsing suggests skipping the steps of sampling parameter(s) values in standard data augmentation. By doing this, we obtain a predictive update version of the Gibbs sampler. A procedure of calculating the posterior odds ratio via the collapsed Gibbs sampler when incomplete observations are involved is presented. As an illustration of possible applications, three examples, along with a Bayesian treatment for identifying common protein binding sites in unaligned DNA sequences, are provided.},

Modern high-throughput technologies generate a broad array of different data types, providing distinct \textendash{} but often complementary \textendash{} information. However, the large amount of data adds burden to any inference task. Flexible Bayesian methods may reduce the necessity for strong modelling assumptions, but can also increase the computational burden. We present an improved implementation of a Bayesian correlated clustering algorithm, that permits integrated clustering to be routinely performed across multiple datasets, each with tens of thousands of items. By exploiting GPU based computation, we are able to improve runtime performance of the algorithm by almost four orders of magnitude. This permits analysis across genomic-scale data sets, greatly expanding the range of applications over those originally possible.

  abstract = {We introduce a statistical model for microarray gene expression data that comprises data calibration, the quantification of differential expression, and the quantification of measurement error. In particular, we derive a transformation h for intensity measurements, and a difference statistic h whose variance is approximately constant along the whole intensity range. This forms a basis for statistical inference from microarray data, and provides a rational data pre-processing strategy for multivariate analyses. For the transformation h, the parametric form h(x) = arsinh(a + bx) is derived from a model of the variance-versus-mean dependence for microarray intensity data, using the method of variance stabilizing transformations. For large intensities, h coincides with the logarithmic transformation, and h with the log-ratio. The parameters of h together with those of the calibration between experiments are estimated with a robust variant of maximum-likelihood estimation. We demonstrate our approach on data sets from different experimental platforms, including two-colour cDNA arrays and a series of Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays.},

Recent results suggest that many enhancers are specified by particular chromatin marks in pluripotent cells, which may be modified later in development to alter patterns of gene expression and cell differentiation choices. These marks may contribute to the repertoire of epigenetic mechanisms responsible for cellular memory and determine the timing of transcription factor accessibility to the enhancer. Mechanistically, cohesin and non-coding RNAs are emerging as crucial players responsible for facilitating enhancer\textendash{}promoter interactions at some genes. Surprisingly, these interactions may be required not only to facilitate initiation of transcription but also to activate the release of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) from promoter-proximal pausing.},

  abstract = {Sequence-based variation in gene expression is a key driver of disease risk. Common variants regulating expression in cis have been mapped in many eQTL studies typically in single tissues from unrelated individuals. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of gene expression across multiple tissues conducted in a large set of mono- and dizygotic twins that allows systematic dissection of genetic (cis and trans) and non-genetic effects on gene expression. Using identity-bydescent estimates, we show that at least 40\% of the total heritable cis-effect on expression cannot be accounted for by common cis-variants, a finding which exposes the contribution of low frequency and rare regulatory variants with respect to both transcriptional regulation and complex trait susceptibility. We show that a substantial proportion of gene expression heritability is trans to the structural gene and identify several replicating trans-variants which act predominantly in a tissue-restricted manner and may regulate the transcription of many genes.},

  abstract = {KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; https://www.kegg.jp/ or https: //www.genome.jp/kegg/) is a reference knowledge base for biological interpretation of genome sequences and other high-throughput data. It is an integrated database consisting of three generic categories of systems information, genomic information and chemical information, and an additional human-specific category of health information. KEGG pathway maps, BRITE hierarchies and KEGG modules have been developed as generic molecular networks with KEGG Orthology nodes of functional orthologs so that KEGG pathway mapping and other procedures can be applied to any cellular organism. Unfortunately, however, this generic approach was inadequate for knowledge representation in the health information category, where variations of human genomes, especially disease-related variations, had to be considered. Thus, we have introduced a new approach where human gene variants are explicitly incorporated into what we call `network variants' in the recently released KEGG NETWORK database. This allows accumulation of knowledge about disease-related perturbed molecular networks caused not only by gene variants, but also by viruses and other pathogens, environmental factors and drugs. We expect that KEGG NETWORK will become another reference knowledge base for the basic understanding of disease mechanisms and practical use in clinical sequencing and drug development.},

  volume = {9},
  issn = {1553-7404},
  abstract = {Polygenic scores have recently been used to summarise genetic effects among an ensemble of markers that do not individually achieve significance in a large-scale association study. Markers are selected using an initial training sample and used to construct a score in an independent replication sample by forming the weighted sum of associated alleles within each subject. Association between a trait and this composite score implies that a genetic signal is present among the selected markers, and the score can then be used for prediction of individual trait values. This approach has been used to obtain evidence of a genetic effect when no single markers are significant, to establish a common genetic basis for related disorders, and to construct risk prediction models. In some cases, however, the desired association or prediction has not been achieved. Here, the power and predictive accuracy of a polygenic score are derived from a quantitative genetics model as a function of the sizes of the two samples, explained genetic variance, selection thresholds for including a marker in the score, and methods for weighting effect sizes in the score. Expressions are derived for quantitative and discrete traits, the latter allowing for case/control sampling. A novel approach to estimating the variance explained by a marker panel is also proposed. It is shown that published studies with significant association of polygenic scores have been well powered, whereas those with negative results can be explained by low sample size. It is also shown that useful levels of prediction may only be approached when predictors are estimated from very large samples, up to an order of magnitude greater than currently available. Therefore, polygenic scores currently have more utility for association testing than predicting complex traits, but prediction will become more feasible as sample sizes continue to grow.},

We call the new methodology consensus clustering, and in conjunction with resampling techniques, it provides for a method to represent the consensus across multiple runs of a clustering algorithm and to assess the stability of the discovered clusters. The method can also be used to represent the consensus over multiple runs of a clustering algorithm with random restart (such as K-means, model-based Bayesian clustering, SOM, etc.), so as to account for its sensitivity to the initial conditions. Finally, it provides for a visualization tool to inspect cluster number, membership, and boundaries. We present the results of our experiments on both simulated data and real gene expression data aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of the methodology in discovering biologically meaningful clusters.},

We begin by reviewing a well-known measure of partition correspondence often attributed to Rand (1971), discuss the issue of correcting this index for chance, and note that a recent normalization strategy developed by Morey and Agresti (1984) and adopted by others (e.g., Milligan and Cooper 1985) is based on an incorrect assumption. Then, the general problem of comparing partitions is approached indirectly by assessing the congruence of two proximity matrices using a simple cross-product measure. They are generated from cOrresponding partitions using various scoring rules. Special cases derivable include traditionally familiar statistics and/or ones tailored to weight certain object pairs differentially. Finally, we propose a measure based on the comparison of object triples having the advantage of a probabilistic interpretation in addition to being corrected for chance (i.e., assuming a constant value under a reasonable null hypothesis) and bounded between -4-I.},

The discovery of different groups of proteins, called pattern recognition molecules (PRMs), which detect microbial components, so-called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and trigger protective responses, had a huge impact on the understanding of innate immune responses. Among the PRMs, the intracellular Nod-like receptors (NLRs) have recently been identified as key mediators of inflammatory and immune responses. The NLR family is divided into subfamilies on the basis of their different signal transduction domains, and recent studies have highlighted the role of certain NLRs, including Nod1, Nod2, Nalp3, Ipaf and Naip5, in the detection of intracellular microbes and possibly `danger signals'. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the function of these proteins in immunity and inflammation, with a focus on their participation in different disease pathologies.},

  abstract = {In this paper we address the problem of obtaining a single clustering estimate c based on an MCMC sample of clusterings c(1), c(2) . . . , c(M) from the posterior distribution of a Bayesian cluster model. Methods to derive c when the number of groups K varies between the clusterings are reviewed and discussed. These include the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate and methods based on the posterior similarity matrix, a matrix containing the posterior probabilities that the observations i and j are in the same cluster. The posterior similarity matrix is related to a commonly used loss function by Binder (1978). Minimization of the loss is shown to be equivalent to maximizing the Rand index between estimated and true clustering. We propose new criteria for estimating a clustering, which are based on the posterior expected adjusted Rand index. The criteria are shown to possess a shrinkage property and outperform Binder's loss in a simulation study and in an application to gene expression data. They also perform favorably compared to other clustering procedures.},

  abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \{\textbackslash\&\} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

The aggregation averages over the versions when predicting a numerical outcome and does a plurality vote when predicting a class. The multiple versions are formed by making bootstrap replicates of the learning set and using these as new learning sets. Tests on real and simulated data sets using classification and regression trees and subset selection in linear regression show that bagging can give substantial gains in accuracy. The vital element is the instability of the prediction method. If perturbing the learning set can cause significant changes in the predictor constructed, then bagging can improve accuracy.},

Large \textasciimacron{}exibility exists in speci\textregistered{}cation of transition matrix of the chain. In practice, however, most algorithms used only allow small changes in the state vector in each iteration. This choice typically causes problems for multimodal distributions as moves between modes become rare and, in turn, results in slow convergence to the target distribution. In this paper we consider continuous distributions on Rn and specify how optimization for local maxima of the target distribution can be incorporated in the speci\textregistered{}cation of the Markov chain. Thereby, we obtain a chain with frequent jumps between modes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in three examples. The \textregistered{}rst considers a simple mixture of bivariate normal distributions, whereas the two last examples consider sampling from posterior distributions based on previously analysed data sets.},

We propose weighted consensus clustering, where each input clustering is weighted and the weights are determined in such a way that the final consensus clustering provides a better quality solution, in which clusters are better separated comparing to standard consensus clustering. Theoretically, we show that a reformulation of the wellknown L1 regularization LASSO problem is equivalent to the weight optimization of our weighted consensus clustering, and thus our approach provides sparse solutions which may resolve the difficult situation when the input clusterings diverge significantly. We also show that the weighted consensus clustering resolves the redundancy problem when many input clusterings correlate highly. Detailed algorithms are given. Experiments are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the weighted consensus clustering.},

Used naively, however, iterative simulation can give misleading answers. Our methods are simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random-effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.},

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new efﬁcient merge-split sampler for both conjugate and nonconjugate Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) models. These Bayesian nonparametric models are usually ﬁt using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or sequential importance sampling (SIS). The latest generation of Gibbs and Gibbs-like samplers for both conjugate and nonconjugate DPM models effectively update the model parameters, but can have difﬁculty in updating the clustering of the data. To overcome this deﬁciency, merge-split samplers have been developed, but until now these have been limited to conjugate or conditionally-conjugate DPM models. This paper proposes a new MCMC sampler, called the sequentially-allocated merge-split (SAMS) sampler. The sampler borrows ideas from sequential importance sampling. Splits are proposed by sequentially allocating observations to one of two split components using allocation probabilities that condition on previously allocated data. The SAMS sampler is applicable to general nonconjugate DPM models as well as conjugate models. Further, the proposed sampler is substantially more efﬁcient than existing conjugate and nonconjugate samplers.},
